Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule translating in file /home/giacomocastagnetti/Downloads/wnv/Snakefile, line 112:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/translation_alignment.fa
Removing output files of failed job translating since they might be corrupted:
results/translation_node_data.json
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
